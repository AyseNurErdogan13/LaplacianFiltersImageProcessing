# Laplacian Filters Image Processing
This project demonstrates the use of Laplacian filters in image processing. A laplacian filter is a type of image processing filter used to enhance the edges of an image by emphasizing the high-frequency components.

## Filter Used:
[[0,-1,0],[-1,4,-1],[0,-1,0]]

## Implementation:
The filter has been applied to an input image using the convolution operation. The resulting image is then displayed.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
